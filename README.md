# Learning Repository: Backend Development in .NET

## Description

This repository is focused on teaching how to program Backend applications using the .NET framework. It differs from other similar resources by prioritizing the understanding of concepts and their rationale, enabling the application of acquired knowledge across various technologies.

.NET is a highly demanded technology today. By taking this repository, you will acquire the fundamental knowledge that employers seek.

Additionally, emphasis is placed on showing both the disadvantages and advantages of using different tools, ensuring a clear understanding of the knowledge.

Throughout the repository, you will learn about the .NET infrastructure for creating Backend applications, as well as the use of tools provided by the ASP framework to avoid reinventing the wheel. However, these tools will be explained in detail.

In addition to learning .NET, focus will be placed on the most commonly used programming language in this context: C#.

Mastering C# and working with .NET will open doors for you in various development areas, not just in the backend. The goal of this repository is for you to understand concepts that you can apply to other technologies.

We hope this repository meets your expectations.
